# Transit-Propulsion-Simulations
VVVF simulation files for various transit propulsion systems

These files can be used with [VVVF Simulator](https://github.com/JOTAN-0655/VVVF-Simulator) to simulate the waveform of various inverters. Feel free to improve them or add your own!  
  
### How to use these files
Download the files or copy their contents to a new .yaml file. Then open it in the program. The controls are "W" for accelerate and "S" for decelerate. Be sure to give credit if you use the sounds in your own content.  
  
## Notes
### Hanabishi GTO-VVVF
This is a fictional inverter. This is used on modernized Akira Kurosawa Rapid Transit System (fictional) Boeing trains.

### Hanabishi IGBT-VVVF
This is a fictional inverter. No vehicles use this yet.

### ADtranz MITRAC 1507C IGBT-VVVF
Used on some BART Rohr cars. The transition from Async to CHM 7P is not actually Async.

### ADtranz MITRAC 1508C IGBT-VVVF
NYC MTA R142A/R143/R188 and MBTA Type 8. The file does not have the transition from Async to Sync PWM.
