# Transit-Propulsion-Simulations
VVVF simulation files for various transit propulsion systems

These files can be used with [VVVF Simulator](https://github.com/JOTAN-0655/VVVF-Simulator) to simulate the waveform of various inverters. Feel free to improve them or add your own!  
  
### How to use these files
Download the files or copy their contents to a new .yaml file. Then open it in the program. The controls are "W" for accelerate and "S" for decelerate. Be sure to give credit if you use the sounds in your own content.  
  
## Notes
### Hanabishi GTO-VVVF
This is a fictional inverter. This is used on modernized Akira Kurosawa Rapid Transit Railway (fictional) Boeing trains.

### Hanabishi IGBT-VVVF
This is a fictional inverter. No vehicles use this yet.

### Alstom ONIX IGBT-VVVF
NYC MTA R160B and WMATA 2000/3000/6000 Series. R160B used as reference. WMATA uses different carrier frequencies. Refurbished LACMTA P2000 may have this.

### GE GTO-VVVF
LA Metro Breda A650's with AC VF propulsion. Also on MBTA 1800 Series.

### ADtranz MITRAC 1507C IGBT-VVVF
Used on some BART Rohr cars. The transition from Async to CHM 7P is not actually Async.

### ADtranz MITRAC 1508C IGBT-VVVF
NYC MTA R142A/R143/R188 and MBTA Type 8. The file does not have the transition from Async to Sync PWM.

### AEG GEATRAC DASU 6.1 GTO-VVVF
Hong Kong MTR ADtranz/CAF EMU on the Tung Chung and Airport Express lines. The file does not have the transition from Async to Sync PWM. Pulse modes may not be correct. I need an induction microphone recording to reference from.
